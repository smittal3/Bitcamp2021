# Bitcamp2021

This a web application created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the hackathon BITCAMP 2021. Team members are Shubham Mittal and Emman Kebede. The web app serves as a one-stop location for resources related to the user's interests. Resources include professional, philanthropic, and educational opportunities. The application aims to increase accessbility to educational resources and make it easier for students and adults in underserved communities to launch their careers. 

In the future, we hope to add resources relating to other fields and interests. Additionally, we wish to implement a form that can get user info too provide personalized infromation based on their level of education, interests, and goals.
